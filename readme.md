## Updates

- I think the best way to develop this (or any other game) would be to create a class to control what happens on the GUI. Probably, I will create a class to manage all events and update the display accordingly.
- I am really trying to avoid just copying and paste any tutorial online. Hope my inspiration gets tuned soon. XD

- Repository creation.
- ```pygame``` it is not compatible with ```Python 3.10```. Downgraded my version to ```3.7.9```.
